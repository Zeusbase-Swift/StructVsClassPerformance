Demonstrates how structures can be more performant than classes using Swift 4 version.

Tests are done for structs/classes with 1 and 10 fields.

- Using default debug settings:
    - struct static func is about 20% faster than class func.
- Using Swift Compiler -O -whole-module-optimization
    - struct static func is about 38% faster than class func.



Compiler settings:
LLVM -Ofast
Swift Compiler -O -whole-module-optimization
